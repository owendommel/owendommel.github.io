     			<p>One of the prijects that we were tasked to complete was an infographic that was based on a type of communication technology. I chose to do my project on fiberoptics.<br></br> The goal of the project was to be able to take information on a topic and present it in a simple to read and legible way. Creativity was also important for this project because without it it becomes boring to read. I mainly focused on the disgn priciples such as repetition, alignment, and contrast. To the left is the result of my infographic.</p></td>
